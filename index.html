    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Badminton is derived from the game <i>"Poona" or "Poonah"</i>. 
      It was developed in the mid-19th century as a variant of the earlier game of <i>"battledore and shuttlecock"</i>. 
      The term battledore refers to the rackets used to play this sport. The most common games can be played in singles 
      or doubles, which is typically done in outdoor settings.
